//! PromptForge inference gateway.
//!
//! A small always-on service that accepts OpenAI-shaped chat completions, holds
//! the backend credential, resolves the request's model name to a configured
//! endpoint, forwards the request, and relays the reply. It is the only process
//! in the system with an edge to an LLM backend, so the executor above it never
//! holds a vendor key.
//!
//! What ships: one OpenAI passthrough at `POST /v1/chat/completions` with
//! bearer auth, model routing, and a typed SSE relay for `stream: true`, an
//! embeddings passthrough at
//! `POST /v1/embeddings` for `kind = "embedding"` models, a rerank
//! passthrough at `POST /v1/rerank` for `kind = "classifier"` models, shared
//! concurrency pools with bounded, fair waiting queues (`[[dominion]]`),
//! gateway-owned local generative inference via a managed `llama-server`
//! subprocess (`[[local_model]]`), named profile checklists from one loaded
//! catalog with bounded-drain `POST /admin/switch-profile` streaming its
//! existing stages over SSE, a bearer-authed `GET /admin/status` readout
//! carrying the command queue's active and pending commands plus one
//! readiness entry per capability endpoint, bearer-authed
//! `POST /admin/queue/cancel` and `POST /admin/queue/cancel-pending`
//! cancelling the queue's active and waiting commands, a bearer-authed
//! `GET /v1/models` catalog, a bearer-authed `GET /admin/config` view of the
//! running global configuration as JSON with secrets redacted, a
//! bearer-authed `GET /admin/progress` SSE
//! stream of the process progress hub, a Brave-backed `POST /v1/tools/web_search`
//! configured by `[tools.web_search]`, an on-demand blob cache
//! (`POST /v1/cache` with SSE download progress, `GET /v1/cache`,
//! `DELETE /v1/cache/{sha256}`) backed by the local artifact store, a
//! bearer-authed `GET /admin/orphans` listing of cache files no loaded
//! `[[local_model]]` entry references (local builds), a bearer-authed
//! `GET /admin/model-info` GGUF-header readout of a cache file's layer and
//! parameter counts (local builds), a bearer-authed
//! `GET /admin/chat-templates` family catalog and per-model effective
//! resolution view (local builds), a bearer-authed
//! `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` OpenAI-compatible multipart STT endpoint
//! (stt builds), a bearer-authed `POST /v1/audio/speech` speech-synthesis
//! passthrough for `kind = "speech"` models streaming the upstream's audio
//! bytes unread, a bearer-authed `GET /v1/audio/voices` union catalog of
//! the speech models' configured voices, a bearer-authed
//! `GET /admin/system` snapshot of host CPU, RAM, cache-drive, and GPU
//! metrics, a bearer-authed `GET /admin/hf/search` and
//! `GET /admin/hf/model/{repo}` proxy onto the Hugging Face hub API
//! (attaching the process `HF_TOKEN` when set), bearer-authed shadow-file
//! write routes staging pending edits beside the real files without ever
//! touching them (`PUT /admin/config`, `PUT /admin/env`) plus a bearer-authed
//! `GET /admin/env` readout of the single config-sibling `.env` file,
//! bearer-authed pending-state reads - `GET /admin/config-pending` (the
//! merged real-plus-shadow view in the `GET /admin/config` shape, with a
//! distinct boot side for the restart-required banner) and
//! `GET /admin/config-dirty` (shadow existence, pending files, changed
//! sections) - bearer-authed `POST /admin/config-apply` (promote every
//! shadow to its real file, then reload the active profile, or report
//! restart-required for a promoted boot shadow) and
//! `POST /admin/config-revert` (delete every shadow, touching nothing
//! else), a loopback-only, bearer-authed `POST /admin/reveal` opening the
//! host OS file manager at a path confined to the artifact cache, a
//! loopback-only, bearer-authed `POST /shutdown` driving the same
//! graceful shutdown Ctrl-C drives - and
//! `GET /health`. The whole admin config surface (config read/write, env,
//! pending state, apply/revert, orphans, system, model-info, the HF
//! proxy, reveal, shutdown) sits behind the shared loopback
//! wall from `shared-loopback` in every build; with the
//! default-on `stt` feature, `WS /v1/realtime?intent=transcription`
//! serves Gateway-owned Realtime transcription beside the batch route;
//! with the
//! `config-ui` feature the embedded config SPA is served at `/config/`
//! behind the same wall, and `GET /auth?key=` sets a session proof
//! derived from the bearer key as an HttpOnly cookie and redirects to the
//! key-free `/config/`, so a browser handoff never leaves the key in
//! browser history. With `[server] trust_loopback` on (the default), a
//! loopback peer presenting no credential is admitted to every route
//! unless its Fetch Metadata marks a cross-origin page; `trust_loopback =
//! false` requires the bearer key from every caller. When the listener is
//! bound to loopback, every route additionally sits behind the shared
//! host-authority wall, which refuses requests whose `Host` is not the
//! bound socket (the DNS-rebinding defense). In-process
//! llama.cpp FFI and endpoint pinning are deferred.

/// spawn:
///
/// 1. **Prepare** (unlocked): the `loading-profile` leaf, the catalog, the
///    target profile's config, remote routing table, and speech artifacts.
/// 2. **Download** (unlocked): every artifact the new local models need,
///    under a `downloading-models` leaf, through the same artifact store
///    the `ProvisionModel` command uses. Cancellation lands at chunk
///    boundaries. Synced persistence temporaries are prepared before cutover.
/// 3. **Cut over** (locked, bounded): the bounded drain, then the old
///    local runtimes stop under a
///    `stopping-models` leaf (only
///    registered when there is something to stop), and one `live.write`
///    publishes the interim state: the new profile's remote models as the
///    routing table, the surviving runtimes, and the local models about to
///    spawn as [`LiveState::loading`].
/// 4. **Spawn** (unlocked): speech quiesces its old generation without
///    detachment, then all target workers start under one deadline. A request for a model in `loading` earns
///    [`GatewayError::ModelLoading`] (503, `Retry-After`); remote models
///    serve.
/// 5. **Commit** (locked, brief): prepared files atomically replace their
///    authoritative targets, then one
///    `live.write` swaps in the full routing table, the runtimes, the
///    profile, and clears `loading`.
///
/// Ordering: the cut-over runs as soon as there is nothing old to stop.
/// When the live state holds no local children and no speech generation (a cold
/// boot, or a remote-only previous profile) phase 3 follows phase 1
/// directly, so the remote models are published before the download
/// starts. Otherwise the download runs first, so the old runtimes keep
/// serving through it, and the cut-over follows. In both orders the old
/// runtimes stop only right before the new ones spawn, never before a
/// download.
///
/// Determinate failure or cancellation after cutover reconstructs speech,
/// restores the prior routing snapshot, and drops target workers. Indeterminate
/// persistence or non-preemptible staging timeout invalidates replacement
/// and requests controlled shutdown. A partial start (some children ready, others
/// failed) is not that case: as before, it commits and swaps the ready
/// children in, and reports the rest through [`GatewayError::PartialStart`].
/// A failure before the cut-over leaves the live state untouched.
///
/// `token` is the command's cancellation: checked at phase boundaries and
/// honored by the download and the local start, so a cancelled switch
/// stops instead of running its remaining phases. `persistence` is evaluated
/// once before cutover, so a debounced duplicate can upgrade an ephemeral
/// load until destructive replacement begins.
