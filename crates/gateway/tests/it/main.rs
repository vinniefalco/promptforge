//! End-to-end Gateway route tests against fake OpenAI backends. Cross-product
//! model-client compatibility lives in the boundary-neutral integration crate.
//!
//! Determinism: the gateway is served on a caller-owned ephemeral listener
//! (no port race), shutdown is driven by a rendezvous `TestServer` fixture,
//! and concurrency tests use an arrivals channel plus per-request release
//! handles instead of sleeps.
//!
//! The suite is split into cohesive area modules (IT-007): shared scaffolding
//! lives in [`support`]; tests are grouped by surface into [`chat`],
//! [`embeddings`], [`rerank`], [`speech`], [`web_search`], [`queue`],
//! [`profiles`], and [`local`]. The `cuda` module holds the opt-in live CUDA
//! proof, and the Windows-only `icon` module pins the exe's embedded program
//! icon.
