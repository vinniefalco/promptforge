//! An `OpenAI`-compatible chat completions client, pointed at the gateway.
//!
//! The client speaks `/chat/completions` and always streams SSE internally:
//! [`GatewayClient::complete`] accumulates the deltas into one text reply or
//! the tool calls the model asked for, invoking the caller's delta callback
//! with each live delta. [`GatewayClient::complete`] sends a
//! `tools` array when the caller supplies one, so the executor's tool-call
//! loop runs over this client. The client holds only the gateway's URL and
//! the shared key; the vendor credential lives in the gateway, so the
//! executor never sees it. Point `PROMPTFORGE_GATEWAY_URL` at a local server
//! or another gateway to retarget it.
//!
//! The implementation lives in the `promptforge-model-client` crate and is
//! re-exported here: hosts pass a [`GatewayClient`] to
//! [`RunConfig::client`](crate::RunConfig) and classify its failures through
//! [`CompletionError`].
