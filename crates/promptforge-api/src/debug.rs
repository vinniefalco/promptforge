//! Opt-in raw model-turn capture.
//!
//! [`DebugCapture`] receives owned request and response payloads for a host
//! that wants them on disk or in a debugger. It is a separate seam from
//! [`crate::observe::Observer`]: observations stay payload-free, and production
//! hosts leave [`crate::execute::RunConfig::debug`] unset so they pay
//! nothing for this path.

use serde_json::Value;

/// An opt-in sink for raw model-turn payloads.
///
/// Implementations own any synchronization they need. The runtime never consults
/// a capture for a decision; dropping every event cannot change the result.
///
/// # Sensitivity
/// A [`DebugEvent`] carries the verbatim request and response bodies, including
/// the full prompt, model output, tool arguments and results, and any store
/// contents that reached the turn. It is raw, unredacted capture: a host that
/// persists it owns treating it as sensitive. The bearer credential is never
/// part of a body (it rides an HTTP header the client never captures).
///
/// # Ordering and delivery
/// Both events for a turn are delivered only after the model round trip
/// succeeds. [`on_event`](Self::on_event) is then called synchronously from the
/// task driving the run, in turn order, with the [`DebugEvent::Request`]
/// delivered before its matching [`DebugEvent::Response`]. A turn whose round
/// trip does not complete - a transport error, cancellation, or a response the
/// client rejects - emits neither event, so a capture records only completed
/// turns and never a lone request.
///
/// Implementations must return promptly (copy into a queue rather than blocking
/// on I/O) and must not panic; a panic unwinds the run.
///
/// # Examples
/// A nonblocking capture copies each event into an in-memory queue and handles
/// events forward-compatibly. [`DebugEvent`] and its variants are
/// `#[non_exhaustive]`, so a wildcard arm is required:
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Mutex;
/// use promptforge_api::debug::{DebugCapture, DebugEvent};
///
/// #[derive(Default)]
/// struct QueueCapture {
///     turns: Mutex<Vec<(String, u32)>>,
/// }
///
/// impl DebugCapture for QueueCapture {
///     fn on_event(&self, _execution: &str, section: &str, turn_index: u32, event: DebugEvent) {
///         // Copy into an in-memory queue; never block on I/O on this path.
///         let kind = match event {
///             DebugEvent::Request { .. } => "request",
///             DebugEvent::Response { .. } => "response",
///             _ => "other",
///         };
///         // Handle poisoning explicitly: this callback must never panic
///         // (a panic unwinds the run), so a poisoned lock is skipped.
///         if let Ok(mut turns) = self.turns.lock() {
