//! Section lifecycle execution and fall-through.
//!
//! The run walks top-level sections in file order, creating one isolated
//! section VM for each. The VM is fully equipped (host values, store, log,
//! control globals) before the shared Lua library replays as the section's
//! first chunk, then ordered section blocks use that same VM. Prose never
//! infers: each prose block stashes the pending Markdown buffer, and the
//! next Lua block reads it as its fresh read-only lazy `prose` template.
//! A scalar Lua return ends the chain it fires in.
//!
//! Running off the last section ends the run: the result is the last
//! scalar return, else a generic completion.
//!
//! The walk is level-independent and never descends on its own: a jump to a
//! child heading starts a child-level walk over the jumper's children under
//! the same rules, and the parent walk resumes after the jumper when that
//! level exhausts.
//!
//! One run-scoped [`VfsRef`] is created once by the caller and threaded through
//! every section, so
//! bulk state persists across the context-clearing transitions even though a
//! section's Lua state never does.
//!
//! A run reports itself as it goes: the [`RunConfig`] observer receives a
//! `(execution, section, event)` record when the run starts and ends, at each
//! section boundary, model turn, tool call, and harness-mediated store
//! operation. Reporting is a side channel and never
//! a decision, so passing [`crate::observe::NullObserver`] changes nothing but
//! the silence.
//!
//! Rust installs tool bindings captured from live H1 into each section VM.
//! Prompt-wide aliases and H2 additions form the effective model-visible scope,
//! which is checked for semantic near-duplicates before concrete tools are
//! advertised under their local aliases and dispatched through the
//! implementation each binding carries.
//!
//! Lua `call()` starts a contained chain at a visible section (fresh VM,
//! recursion capped at 8): the chain runs from the target
//! with every normal walk rule - fall-through, jumps, child
//! chains - and the outer walk never moves while it runs. When the chain
//! ends (its level exhausts or a return fires), its final text is the call's
//! return value; a return ends only the chain it fires in.
//! Lua `jump(target)` transfers control to a named section.
//!
//! # Runtime
//!
//! One driver task runs a whole prompt: section Lua yields request messages
//! to the chain-stack scheduler, which awaits I/O without blocking a worker
//! thread and resumes the chain with the answer, so a run needs no
//! particular Tokio runtime flavor - a current-thread runtime runs any
//! prompt, host calls included. Concurrency (a fanout's arms) comes from
//! interleaving chains at I/O points on the driver's thread, not from
//! worker threads.
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! The orchestration boundary ([`run`]) lives here; the rest is split into
//! focused private children: `error` (the public [`RunError`]), `config`
//! (`RunConfig`/`RunLimits`), `context` (the ambient `RunContext` run
//! state), `gateway` (client acquisition and [`ResolutionContext`]),
//! `tools` (the nested-inference round),
//! `section_vm` (the section VM setup half shared by the walk and
//! the fanout arm), `section_context` (the per-section `SectionContext`
//! frame the scheduler's chains construct, run, and tear down),
//! `engine` (the walk-target
//! resolution helpers), `protocol` (the coroutine request/answer types
//! for the yield/resume boundary), `scheduler` (the chain-stack scheduler
//! driving the coroutine protocol: the live H1 pass, the walk, call
//! chains, and fanout), `scope` (tool-scope
//! validation and schema/dispatch preparation), `tool_loop` (the
//! Rust-backed model-tool loop behind the section-visible `models.loop`),
//! and `support` (shared helpers).

/// # Errors
/// Returns a [`RunError`] whose [`kind`](RunError::kind) classifies the failure
/// by condition:
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Parse`] - a prompt/frontmatter or compiled Lua region was
///   invalid.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Version`] - the prompt declared an unsupported
///   `promptforge:` major.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Binding`] - a `tools.bind`/`models.bind` capability could
///   not be bound, was absent, or clashed.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Completion`] - a model completion failed at the transport,
///   backend, or decode layer.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Tool`] - a dispatched tool failed, was out of scope, or the
///   tool loop did not converge.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Lua`] - a section's Lua phase failed to run or return a
///   usable value.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Quota`] - a Lua host resource quota (log events, log bytes,
///   or instructions) was exhausted.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::ContextExhausted`] - the selected compactor exhausted the
///   model's context window.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Input`] - the host's input broker failed a `user_input`
///   request.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Substitution`] - a `{{ }}` prose substitution failed.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Store`] - a run-scoped store operation failed.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Determinism`] - two live execution identities claimed
///   one store path; the run terminated on the spot, uncatchably from Lua.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Cancelled`] - the host cancelled the run.
/// - [`RunErrorKind::Internal`] - an internal invariant failed.

/// multi-thread runtime only the leaf I/O waits, which never touch Lua or
/// scheduler state, may run on other workers.
