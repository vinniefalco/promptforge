//! Walk-target resolution: the visible-set machinery every control transfer
//! resolves against.
//!
//! A running section may address only its visible set: its home slice minus
//! itself, plus its direct children. The parent, aunts/uncles,
//! nieces/nephews, and grandchildren are never in the set, so a resolution
//! error that lists the set cannot leak the rest of the document's
//! structure. The scheduler's chains resolve jumps, `call` targets, and
//! fanout workers through these helpers, and the `list_from_section`
//! callback resolves through them too, so every control surface agrees on
//! what a heading may name.
