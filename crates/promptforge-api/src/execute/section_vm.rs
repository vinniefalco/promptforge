//! The engine's setup half: one section VM's lifecycle from host injection
//! through the captured alias bindings.
//!
//! Every driver of the shared engine - the walk's section entry and the
//! fanout arm - runs the identical setup sequence: inject the host values,
//! install the persistent host APIs, install the control globals, replay the
//! shared library as the section's first chunk, then install the captured
//! alias bindings (so a declared alias wins over a same-named shared global).
//! Only the deltas live at the call site: the driver builds its own `sys`
//! JSON (both drivers take the next run-global `id`; the arm adds its
//! per-fanout `index`), picks the [`VmSeed`] (the walk's rolled-forward
//! `var`; an arm
//! adds its collection `item` to the caller's cloned `var`), and supplies
//! the `list_from_section` callback resolved over its own visible set.
//!
//! VM construction and the Lua limits install stay with the driver. A
//! construction failure's handling differs (the walk propagates, the arm
//! finishes its finalizer), and a limits failure must keep
//! propagating as a bare `?` - routing it through teardown would emit
//! `LUA_TEARDOWN_STARTED`/`SUCCEEDED` events the walk never emitted. For the
//! same reason a failed setup returns the VM untorn-down: each driver owns
//! its teardown boundary.
