//! The nested-inference round a section's `models.infer` yields resolve to.
//!
//! One `infer` shape only: a single direct, tool-free gateway round on a
//! fresh conversation. `models.infer(handle, prompt)` runs it with the
//! handle's frozen binding; `models.infer(prompt)` resolves the section's
//! current model and runs the same path. Neither form advertises tools, sets
//! `reply`, or touches `sys`. A Lua block that needs tools uses `call`
//! on a section. The scheduler's leaf dispatch spawns the round and resumes
//! the yielding chain with its outcome.
