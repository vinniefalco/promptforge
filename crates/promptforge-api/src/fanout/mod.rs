//! Explicit fanout: map a worker section over a collection of members.
//!
//! A section's Lua calls `fanout(worker, collection)` to run the worker
//! template once per collection member. The collection is any Lua table: the
//! array part (`1..=#t`) iterates in order first, then the hash part in
//! undefined order. An array member arrives as the arm's `item` value as
//! itself; a hash member arrives as a pair table (`item.key` / `item.value`).
//! A list section's pre-parsed items feed in through `list_from_section`:
//! `fanout("### Worker", list_from_section("### List"))`.
//!
//! The scheduler drives the fanout: the call yields a structural request,
//! and the driver forks one arm chain per member (at most the run's
//! `max_fanout_concurrency` active at once), joins them, and resumes the
//! caller with the ordered results. This module carries the pieces that
//! boundary shares: [`resolve_sibling`] (the exact `(level, name)` heading
//! resolution every control surface uses) and [`ArmFinalizer`] (the
//! exactly-once terminal-observation guard every arm chain carries). The
//! member-wise collection conversion at the protocol boundary lives in the
//! `promptforge-lua` crate, beside the VM and the coroutine protocol that
//! consume it.
