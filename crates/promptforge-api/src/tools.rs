//! Tools the executor can dispatch during a model's tool-call loop.
//!
//! Some tools run locally in this process (for example fetching and rendering a
//! web page), while others proxy through the gateway so a shared credential
//! never leaves the server. Both kinds share the [`Tool`] trait so the executor
//! can dispatch them uniformly. Stable identity is separate from the wire name
//! used by the current model transport.
//!
//! The runtime-agnostic contract vocabulary ([`Tool`], [`ToolCatalog`],
//! [`ToolId`], the output and error types) lives in the
//! `shared-promptforge-api` crate's `tools` module and is re-exported here
//! unchanged, so existing
//! `promptforge_api::tools::*` paths keep working. The concrete `WebSearch`
//! provider lives in the `promptforge-web-search` crate and is re-exported
//! here under its historical path for the same reason.
