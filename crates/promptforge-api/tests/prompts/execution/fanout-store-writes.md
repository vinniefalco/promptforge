# Fanout Store Writes

## Research

```lua
local replies = fanout("### Worker", list_from_section("### Topics"))
local files = store.glob("arm-*.md")
-- The ordered merge: the join delivers arm results in collection order,
-- never finish order, so the parent's merge is deterministic by
-- construction.
store.write("merged.md", table.concat(replies, ","))
return tostring(#files) .. ":" .. table.concat(replies, ",")
```

### Worker

```lua
-- Arm-scoped writes: the pattern the claims model teaches. Each arm writes
-- only its own path, so no two live identities ever claim one path, and the
-- parent's post-join glob reads the merged state after every arm's claims
-- released at its end. (The old ready-*.md rendezvous - polling a sibling
-- arm's files while that arm is live - is exactly the cross-arm
-- read-while-written pattern the claims model rejects.)
store.write("arm-" .. sys.index .. ".md", item)
return item
```

Write to store.
