//! The chain-stack scheduler: the coroutine protocol's driver loop.
//!
//! One [`Scheduler`] per run, created and owned by the top-level run call
//! and living entirely in the driver loop's stack frame: no `Arc`, no
//! `Mutex`, no sharing. One thread runs every chain step, and the Lua shims
//! only yield (they never call into Rust for suspending operations), so the
//! scheduler state is unreachable from Lua. Leaf dispatch spawns plain
//! tasks: an infer task touches no scheduler state and no Lua value, so
//! the driver future stays `Send` and the run may be spawned onto a
//! multi-thread runtime; on a current-thread runtime the whole run stays
//! on its one thread.
//!
//! The loop is `resume -> match request -> dispatch -> resume with answer`.
//! A chain whose coroutine yields a leaf request (`infer`) is parked in the
//! pending table while a spawned task runs the single gateway round and
//! posts the answer to the channel; a chain that yields a structural
//! request (`call`) blocks while its child chain runs, and the child's
//! finish delivers its final text as the parent's answer. When no chain is
//! ready the driver awaits the answer channel or cancellation, whichever
//! comes first.
//!
//! [`RunContext`] stays the ambient shared read-mostly context, borrowed by
//! chain steps; the scheduler is the exclusively owned mutable counterpart.
//! The two are deliberately not merged: `RunContext` is cloned into
//! callbacks, while the scheduler must stay unreachable from the callback
//! layer.
//!
//! This module carries the scheduler core plus the walk rules: sections run
//! in fall-through order, `var` rolls
//! forward across sections and jumps, every section entry
//! takes the next run-global id, and a jump transfers control - a sibling
//! move within the chain's slice, or a descent into the jumper's child
//! slice with the parent position suspended on the chain's own position
//! stack until the child level exhausts. A drive armed with
//! [`Scheduler::with_live_h1`] runs the live H1 pass first: the prompt's
//! H1 blocks as the driver loop's first chain, under the live pass's rules
//! (id 0, no section observations, a jump is an error, a scalar return
//! short-circuits the run), with the root walk starting from the H1 `var`
//! hand-off. A `fanout` request forks N arm chains (one per collection
//! member) interleaved by the driver: at most the run's
//! `max_fanout_concurrency` arms are active at once, each arm runs the
//! same walk machinery as any chain over the worker's blocks, and the join
//! state's preallocated per-index slots deliver the results to the parent
//! in collection order, never finish order. The fanout failure semantics
//! match the legacy engine: an empty collection errors before any
//! scheduling, a fatal arm error aborts the sibling arms (each aborted
//! arm's finalizer reports `FANOUT_ARM_CANCELLED`, so exactly one terminal
//! observation fires per arm), [`Error::ToolLoopExhausted`] soft-degrades
//! its arm to the incomplete stub, and two live arms of one fanout touching
//! the same store path with at least one write terminate the whole run with
//! the claims model's fatal determinism violation, intercepted at the
//! answer boundary so no author `pcall` can catch it. Every store operation
//! is such a leaf yield, answered on the blocking pool uniformly for all
//! backends - no inline fast path - so interleaving behavior never depends
//! on which backend serves the mount. A received `mcp` request
//! is the protocol's typed reserved error.
