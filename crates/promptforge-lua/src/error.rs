//! [`Error`] mirrors the role `promptforge-api`'s substrate plays there: it
//! is never part of the documented API. The executor's public boundary
//! (`promptforge_api::RunError`) wraps and classifies core's own substrate,
//! which maps this one back variant-for-variant through
//! `From<promptforge_lua::Error>`. The substrate is `#[doc(hidden)]` and
//! re-exported only so `promptforge-api` can perform that mapping verbatim;
//! it is not a stable API and is not marked `#[non_exhaustive]`, so the
//! mapping stays total.
