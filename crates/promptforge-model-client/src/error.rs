//! The crate's internal error substrate.
//!
//! [`Error`] mirrors the role `promptforge-api`'s substrate plays there: it is
//! never part of the documented API. Every public boundary returns its own
//! typed error ([`crate::model::CompletionError`], [`crate::client::SecretError`],
//! [`crate::model::ModelIdError`]); those wrappers classify this substrate and
//! preserve its source. The substrate is `#[doc(hidden)]` and re-exported only
//! so `promptforge-api` can map every variant back onto its own substrate
//! verbatim; it is not a stable API and is not marked `#[non_exhaustive]`, so
//! that mapping stays total.
