//! The PromptForge gateway's model client and model-catalog vocabulary.
//!
//! [`client`] holds the `OpenAI`-compatible chat-completions transport:
//! [`client::GatewayClient`] speaks the always-streaming `/chat/completions`
//! SSE shape to one gateway URL with a shared bearer key, and the wire types
//! ([`client::Message`], [`client::ToolSchema`], [`client::Completion`],
//! [`client::StreamDelta`]) are what it exchanges. [`model`] holds the
//! catalog and prompt-local binding vocabulary: [`model::ModelCatalog`]
//! built from the gateway's
//! `GET /v1/models`, the validated [`model::ModelId`] identity, and the
//! [`model::ModelBinding`]/[`model::ModelSet`]/[`model::ModelView`] types a
//! host resolves and freezes model selections through.
//!
//! The metrics vocabulary ([`Usage`], [`LlamaTimings`], [`VllmMetrics`],
//! [`ClientTiming`], [`CallMetrics`]) is canonical in
//! `shared-promptforge-api` and re-exported here: the client parses each
//! response body's call metadata into it, and [`client::Completion`] carries
//! the result. The model identity/catalog vocabulary ([`model::ModelId`],
//! [`model::ModelCatalog`], [`model::ModelDescriptor`],
//! [`model::ThinkingMode`]) and the streaming [`client::StreamDelta`] are
//! canonical there too and re-exported through their historical paths.
//!
//! The crate contains no prompt parser, no Lua runtime, and no executor; it is
//! the gateway's model client only, never a universal client.
