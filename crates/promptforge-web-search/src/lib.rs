//! The `web_search` tool: proxy a search query through the gateway.
//!
//! This crate is the concrete search provider. It does not talk to a search
//! vendor directly; it POSTs the query to the gateway's
//! `POST /v1/tools/web_search` endpoint with the shared bearer token, so the
//! vendor credential never leaves the server. The gateway's JSON results are
//! validated for shape and returned as untrusted output, ready to hand back to
//! the model.
//!
//! The whole supported surface is [`WebSearch`]; the endpoint validation and
//! the redacted bearer token are crate-private implementation details. The
//! tool vocabulary ([`Tool`](shared_promptforge_api::tools::Tool),
//! [`ToolError`](shared_promptforge_api::tools::ToolError), and their kinds)
//! comes from `shared-promptforge-api`.
