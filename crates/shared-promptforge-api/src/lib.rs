//! Small shared host-support primitives for the PromptForge runtime.
//!
//! [`untrusted`] wraps untrusted external data in a nonce-guarded envelope,
//! [`cancel`] is the cooperative cancellation handle and task-local scope a
//! run observes, [`observe`] is the report-only vocabulary a run reports its
//! progress through, and [`events`] is the canonical metrics and
//! runtime-event vocabulary with the read-side
//! [`EventLog`](events::EventLog) a host may supply as a run input.
//! [`models`] is the host-facing model vocabulary (identity, catalog,
//! descriptor) and [`wire`] the streaming delta a host's `on_delta`
//! callback observes. [`tools`] is the runtime-agnostic tool contract:
//! the [`Tool`](tools::Tool) trait, the caller-provided
//! [`ToolCatalog`](tools::ToolCatalog), trusted output, and the model-safe
//! tool error. This
//! crate depends on no other promptforge crate, so every promptforge crate
//! may depend on it.
