//! Report-only observation for a run in flight.
//!
//! [`Observer`] receives a borrowed `(execution, section)` pair and one typed
//! [`Observation`] at operational boundaries. The observation is the complete
//! lifecycle trace record. Fixed runtime observations carry no raw prompt
//! prose, model input or output, tool arguments or results, store paths or
//! contents, credentials, or fetched content. Reports are synchronous and
//! never consulted for a decision. [`NullObserver`] provides silence without a
//! second execution path.
//!
//! The `on_*` content methods are the second reporting family: default-body
//! hooks carrying completed content events - assistant replies, tool-call
//! batches, tool results, thinking, and user input - as untrusted payloads
//! with their [`CallMetrics`]. A content report records what happened, never
//! assembled framing: no system prompts, no injected files, no tool schemas.
//! Like [`observe`](Observer::observe), content reports are write-only and
//! never read back; the read-side history a host may keep is the separate
//! [`EventLog`](crate::events::EventLog).
//!
//! # Sensitivity of metadata
//! The variant *identity* of a fixed [`Observation`] is safe, but four inputs
//! are author-controlled and must be treated as potentially sensitive untrusted
//! metadata, not as safe fixed vocabulary:
//! - `execution` - a caller-chosen run identifier;
//! - `section` - the prompt's H2 heading text, authored in the prompt file;
//! - [`Observation::Lua`] and [`Observation::Other`] messages - a validated Lua
//!   `log(message)` checkpoint and the forward-compatible escape hatch;
//! - every `on_*` content payload - text, arguments, and results are model-,
//!   tool-, or user-authored.
//!
//! An [`Observer`] that persists or forwards reports owns treating `execution`,
//! `section`, and any message-carrying variant as untrusted: they can echo
//! prompt-authored text, so a sink must not log them into a trusted context, and
//! prompt authors must never place arguments, replies, tool data, credentials,
//! paths, or store contents in a `log(message)`.
