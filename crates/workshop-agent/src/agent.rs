//! `run_agent` and its leaf-dispatch driver.
//!
//! An agent program is one Lua chunk run as one coroutine on an agent VM -
//! a [`SectionVm`] built with the section construction sequence (harden,
//! untrusted, host injection, store, log, var) minus the section control
//! surface. The shared kernel is `models.infer` and `tool_call`; the
//! agent-only `models.chat` is installed here and nowhere else; `execute`,
//! `fanout`, and `jump` are absent, not stubbed, so touching them is an
//! undefined-global failure. The driver is leaf dispatch only: it resumes
//! the coroutine, validates each yield into a [`Request`], awaits exactly
//! one future - the current request - and resumes with the answer. Tool
//! dispatch goes through the shared [`dispatch_tool`] body; nothing here
//! duplicates it. Before every resume the driver republishes the
//! `runtime.events()` length bound ([`EventsSnapshot::refresh`]) - the
//! resume-refresh rule: appends land in the program's view only at
//! host-call resumes, never mid-chunk, so reads between suspensions stay
//! deterministic.
//!
//! `run_agent` installs [`AgentConfig::cancel`] as the task's cancel scope:
//! suspended host calls race cancellation, and running Lua observes the
//! same flag through the VM's instruction hook. Teardown is observed like a
//! section's, under the agent's name as the `section` label.
