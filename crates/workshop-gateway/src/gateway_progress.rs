//! The gateway progress subscriber: a background task that imports the
//! gateway's `GET /admin/progress` event stream into the workshop
//! [`ProgressHub`] as a [`RemoteOperation`], so gateway-side work (model
//! downloads, profile switches) renders on the status bar through the same
//! renderer task as local operations.
//!
//! The task follows the heartbeat's lifecycle posture: spawned with the
//! server, stopped through its [`Subscriber`] handle inside the same
//! graceful-shutdown signal, and driven by the shared [`GatewayHealth`]
//! verdict rather than by probes of its own. It subscribes while the
//! gateway reads reachable and idles while it does not; a reconnect
//! resubscribes, and each subscription tracks one import per upstream
//! operation id, so interleaved work stays separate and a finished operation
//! detaches without closing the long-lived event stream.
//! When the subscription drops - a lost connection or an unreachable
//! verdict - the import detaches with it, because progress from a gateway
//! the workshop can no longer hear is stale, not informative.
