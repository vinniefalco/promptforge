//! Gateway endpoint resolution: a live gateway discovery file in the run
//! directory first, explicit `[gateway]` config second.
//!
//! The sidecar gateway writes `gateway.json` after a successful bind (see
//! `shared-sidecar`), so a workshop that finds a live file attaches to
//! that gateway - loopback, WSL, or LAN become one topology. A stale file
//! is condemned with its reason (the probe removes it) and explicit config
//! takes over; with no live file and no explicit config there is nothing
//! to connect to, which is the plain [`ResolveError`].
