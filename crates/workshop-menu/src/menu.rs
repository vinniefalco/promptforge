//! The server-owned Model menu: the workbench snapshot pushed to every
//! `/ws` session as a `{"type":"workbench",...}` frame, its broadcast
//! bus, and the per-profile model memory persisted in the state directory.
//!
//! The server owns all Model-menu state and the UI only renders it; in
//! particular `chat_ready` is computed here - a chat-capable model
//! selected, no switch in flight, gateway reachable - and never derived
//! client-side. Like the catalog bus, the channel is a tokio broadcast:
//! publishing never blocks, a publish with no sessions is a no-op, and a
//! lagging session skips ahead - every push is a complete snapshot, so an
//! overwritten one loses nothing. The bus also retains the newest push,
//! so a session that connects later sends the current menu immediately -
//! the delivery contract's resend-on-reconnect for ephemeral frames.
//!
//! Mutation is zone two throughout: a refused mutation (an unknown model
//! id, a second switch while one runs) is a value returned to the caller,
//! and a missing, unreadable, or corrupt memory file means "no memory
//! yet" - logged and tolerated, never fatal. The memory file holds server
//! state only; the UI's panel layout is view state and stays in the
//! webview's localStorage.
