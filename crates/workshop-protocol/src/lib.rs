//! workshop-protocol - the wire protocol of the workshop sockets: every
//! JSON frame the server exchanges with the UI, typed in one place, with
//! zero I/O.
//!
//! Frames are grouped by direction - inbound (client to server) first,
//! outbound (server to client) second. Nothing here touches a socket, a
//! task, or a clock, so every wire shape is pinned by the plain tests in
//! `tests/it`. The TypeScript half of this contract is
//! `workshop-server/ui/src/services/protocol.ts`; the two files
//! cross-cite each other so a shape change touches both or neither. The
//! agent-session frame family is additionally pinned by the shared
//! fixture `tests/fixtures/agent-frames.json`, asserted as the same JSON
//! by the fixture test here and by the SPA suite's
//! `workshop-server/ui/test/agent-wire-fixtures.mjs`, so drift on either
//! side fails that side's tests. The wire shapes are additionally frozen
//! end to end by the characterization tests in `workshop-server`'s
//! `tests/it`.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! - Tier: vocabulary; may depend on: no internal `workshop-*` crates.
//!   Read `AGENTS.md` before adding an import.
//! - Every file in this crate stays under 500 lines; split first, then
//!   edit.
//! - Zero I/O: no sockets, tasks, or clocks, so every wire shape is
//!   pinned by a plain test.
//!
//! # Inbound workshop-socket frames
//!
//! `{"type":"select_model","model":"..."}` selects the chat model: the
//! menu validates the id against the retained catalog and publishes a
//! fresh [`WorkbenchFrame`] on success; an unknown model is refused
//! with an `error` frame. `{"type":"switch_profile","name":"..."}`
//! starts a gateway profile switch: the pending snapshot publishes
//! immediately, stage progress arrives as [`StatusFrame`]s, and the
//! settled menu publishes a final [`WorkbenchFrame`] and a
//! [`CatalogFrame`]; a switch requested while one runs is refused with
//! an `error` frame. Both events may carry an optional `id`, echoed on
//! the `error` frame that refuses them.
//!
//! No inbound frame is pushed by the server, so none takes a delivery
//! classification; the reply frames they trigger are classified below.
//!
//! # Agent-session frames
//!
//! The `/agents/ws` socket speaks its own frame family. On connect the
//! server pushes [`AgentsFrame`], the discovered agent list. The client
//! opens a session with `{"type":"launch","agent":"..."}` or reattaches
//! with `{"type":"attach","session":"..."}`; either is answered with
//! [`AgentSessionFrame`] naming the session id. A running session streams
//! [`AgentEventFrame`]s - the durable event log, each frame carrying its
//! log index, replayed from the top on attach - and [`AgentDeltaFrame`]s,
//! the ephemeral live chunks, each stamped with the `reply` id of the
//! durable event that will supersede it. `{"type":"cancel"}` fires the
//! session's turn-cancel: cancellation is a stop reason, never an error -
//! no error frame follows, pending waits die as `input_cancelled`, and
//! the relaunched agent returns to waiting. Frames already in flight
//! from the cancelled run may still arrive between the cancel and the
//! relaunch: a defined grace window, absorbed by the reply-id
//! coalescing (the cancelled round never settles, so its deltas fall to
//! the round that eventually does), never a protocol violation.
//!
//! A session-level failure is pushed as an id-less [`ErrorFrame`]: a
//! model round that failed while the program survived it (the built-in
//! chat `pcall`s `models.chat` and returns to waiting), or a run that
//! ended in error. Delivery on this socket: ephemeral - the reports ride
//! a bounded broadcast beside the deltas and may drop under lag; the
//! durable transcript already shows the failed turn as one without a
//! reply, and terminal failures also land on the status bus.
//!
//! # Agent-session input frames
//!
//! An agent session asks its operator for input through the Workshop's
//! `user_input` tool. Three frames carry that conversation: the server
//! pushes [`InputFrame::Required`] when a wait opens and
//! [`InputFrame::Cancelled`] when one dies unresolved, and the client
//! answers with an `input_response` frame parsed as [`InputResponse`].
//! Both pushed frames are durable: the wait registry retains every
//! unresolved wait and the session resends it on reconnect, so a push
//! lost to a dead socket is repaired by the resent set - a live wait
//! reappears, and a stale prompt is dropped because its token is absent.
//! Cancellation is an explicit outcome, never silence: every path out of
//! an unresolved wait pushes `input_cancelled` for its token. The session
//! loops that route these frames arrive with agent sessions; the shapes
//! and classification are pinned here first.
//!
//! # Delivery contract
//!
//! Every frame the server pushes carries exactly one of two delivery
//! semantics. The session loops are built on this classification, so no
//! pushed frame type ships unclassified.
//!
//! **Durable** frames are delivered exactly, and coalesce. Where the
//! data is shared fan-out state, the producer records it and wakes each
//! connection loop through a `Notify`; the loop compares the shared
//! revision against its own per-client cursor and sends everything past
//! the cursor, so a missed wakeup is harmless because the next one
//! delivers everything past the cursor. A durable frame that answers
//! the connection's own request (a `launch` acknowledgment) is sent
//! directly by the loop that owns the socket, which delivers exactly
//! without any cursor - no shared state exists for a cursor to index.
//!
//! **Ephemeral** frames may drop under lag. They ride bounded channels
//! (a broadcast where the state fans out); a client too slow to drain
//! its channel lags out and its connection may drop. The drop is
//! harmless because every ephemeral frame has a repair path that owes
//! nothing to its predecessors: status and catalog are complete
//! snapshots resent on reconnect.
//!
//! ## Classification
//!
//! Workshop socket (`/ws`):
//!
//! - [`ErrorFrame`] - durable on this socket. The direct reply refusing
//!   a malformed frame or a menu event, sent by the loop that owns the
//!   socket - the contract's no-cursor case.
//! - [`StatusFrame`] - ephemeral. Every update is a complete snapshot of
//!   the bar, so a lagging client loses nothing by skipping
//!   intermediates, and the current status is resent on reconnect.
//! - [`CatalogFrame`] - ephemeral. Each push carries the whole catalog
//!   verbatim; the newest push supersedes every older one and the
//!   catalog is resent on reconnect.
//! - [`WorkbenchFrame`] - ephemeral. Every push is a complete snapshot
//!   of the server-owned Model-menu state, retained and resent on
//!   reconnect, exactly like the catalog frame. The connect-time send -
//!   the retained snapshot follows the status and catalog snapshots on
//!   every new session, so the UI boots with zero HTTP state fetches -
//!   is that resend promise, not a third delivery class.
