//! The intent-named push facade over the producer sink slots: business
//! code reports what happened and never chooses a severity or builds a
//! bus payload (SiYuan's `PushReloadFiletree` pattern).
//!
//! Producers hold a [`Push`] and speak in intents - a status update, a
//! failure, an activity pulse, determinate progress, idle, a fresh model
//! catalog; workbench producers drive the Model-menu mutators through
//! [`Push::menu`], and every mutation publishes its own snapshot. What
//! each intent becomes on the wire is decided here and in
//! `workshop-protocol`, nowhere else. The sinks stay the transport:
//! every `/ws` session subscribes to the status, catalog, and menu
//! buses behind the sink slots and serializes what it receives.
//!
//! Every intent degrades to a no-op while its sink slot is empty, so a
//! producer spawned before its subsystem registers never fails.
