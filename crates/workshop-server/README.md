The PromptForge Workshop HTTP server. It serves a local UI and API on loopback: agent sessions (Markdown agent prompts on the unified `promptforge-api` runtime), an OpenAI-shaped model catalog passthrough in front of a PromptForge gateway, workspace APIs, and a same-origin payload-opaque relay to Gateway Realtime transcription. The desktop shell (`workshop`) embeds it in-process; run standalone it is the browser-tab frame.

## Quick start

Create a `workshop.toml` in the current directory. Every field is optional and the defaults are built in:

```toml
[gateway]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
# Optional for a loopback gateway: with the gateway's default
# trust_loopback = true, a same-machine caller that presents no key is
# admitted. Required when the gateway is on another host or its operator
# set trust_loopback = false.
api_key = "${PROMPTFORGE_GATEWAY_API_KEY}"
```

A gateway that trusts loopback callers trusts every OS account on that machine, including reading upstream API keys from the gateway's admin config surface; on a shared machine the gateway operator sets `trust_loopback = false`, and then this key is required.

Then run:

```bash
cargo run -p workshop-server
```

The server binds `127.0.0.1:7910` by default and serves the chat UI at `http://127.0.0.1:7910/`. Set `server.open_browser = true` to have it open your system browser once it is serving.

The desktop shell (`workshop`) is the zero-config path: it embeds this server in-process on an OS-assigned loopback port, discovering `workshop.toml` beside its executable, then the current directory, then `~/.promptforge/` - the file supplies only the `[gateway]` connection and the path settings, since the shell owns the listener. The server binary does not generate one - it reads `workshop.toml` from the current directory, or `workbench.toml` there if the canonical name is missing.

String values support `${VAR}` environment interpolation; `$$` is a literal `$`, and an unset variable interpolates to the empty string.

## Configuration

Every field of `workshop.toml`:

| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gateway.base_url` | (empty) | Base URL of the PromptForge gateway. A live `gateway.json` gateway discovery file in `~/.promptforge/run` (written by a running gateway) wins over this setting; the explicit value is the fallback for a gateway discovery cannot see, such as a LAN gateway. With no live file and no explicit value, startup fails plainly: no gateway configured or running |
| `gateway.api_key` | (empty) | Bearer key for the gateway API; supports `${VAR}` interpolation; empty sends no `Authorization` header, which a loopback gateway with the default `trust_loopback = true` accepts (a LAN gateway, or one with `trust_loopback = false`, answers 401) |
| `server.bind` | `127.0.0.1:7910` | Address the workshop server binds to |
| `server.open_browser` | `false` | When true, the server binary opens the system browser at its address once serving; the desktop shell ignores it |
| `server.state_dir` | the config file's directory | Directory holding the server's persistent state: agent session event logs live under `state_dir/sessions/`, and the per-profile model memory is written here |
| `agents.path` | `agents/` beside the config file | Directory whose `.md` files are launchable agent prompts alongside the embedded built-in `chat` agent; a directory `chat.md` shadows the embedded source, and a missing directory offers exactly the built-in |

## Routes

| Route | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | Health probe; answers `{"status":"serving"}` |
| `GET /` | The chat UI (also `/app.js`, `/app.css`, `/style.css`, `/pcm-worklet.js`, bundled by the crate's build script: read from disk in debug builds, embedded in the binary in release builds) |
| `GET /v1/models` | Proxies the gateway's model catalog verbatim; while the gateway is known down, answers 502 `gateway_unreachable` without attempting it |
| `GET /v1/realtime` | Same-origin WebSocket relay to the gateway's fixed `/v1/realtime?intent=transcription` target; validates browser Origin, attaches gateway authentication upstream, rejects subprotocols, preserves text, binary, and close frames, and never parses speech payloads |
| `GET /ws` | WebSocket upgrade, one persistent socket for the workshop's downstream JSON: unsolicited `{"type":"status","label","description","severity","activity","progress"}` observer updates, `{"type":"models","models":[...]}` catalog pushes, and `{"type":"workbench",...}` Model-menu snapshots out; `{"type":"select_model","model"}` and `{"type":"switch_profile","name"}` menu events in, refusals answered with `{"type":"error","message"}` frames |
| `GET /agents/ws` | WebSocket upgrade for one agent session: the discovered agent list on connect, `{"type":"launch","agent"}` / `{"type":"attach","session"}` in (acknowledged with `{"type":"agent_session","session","agent"}`), then durable `{"type":"agent_event","index","event",...}` log entries, ephemeral `{"type":"agent_delta","kind","content","reply"}` streaming chunks, and the `input_required` / `input_cancelled` wait frames answered by `{"type":"input_response","token","text"}`; `{"type":"cancel"}` fires turn-cancel |

## Gateway discovery and resilience

At startup the server resolves the gateway endpoint: a live `gateway.json` gateway discovery file in the run directory (`~/.promptforge/run`) wins - the gateway writes it after a successful bind, and it is validated by pid, process image, health answer, and bearer key - then explicit `[gateway]` config. A stale file is removed and its reason (dead pid, foreign image, failed health, rejected key) is reported on the status bus and in the log before the config fallback is used. With no live file and no explicit `gateway.base_url`, startup fails plainly: no gateway configured or running.

A background heartbeat polls the gateway's `GET /health` every five seconds and reports transitions on the status bus: "Gateway unreachable" when the gateway stops answering, "Connected to gateway" when it comes back. While the gateway is known down, `GET /v1/models` answers 502 `gateway_unreachable` instead of waiting on a dead connection, and the Model menu's `chat_ready` reads false. A reconnect re-fetches the model catalog and pushes it to every `/ws` session as a `{"type":"models",...}` frame, so a UI that booted during the outage refreshes its model picker by itself. Once an endpoint has resolved, the server boots and serves the UI whether or not the gateway has ever answered.

An embedding host can publish a local Gateway replacement only by presenting `shared_sidecar::ValidatedConnection`; raw gateway discovery files are not accepted. The cancellable publication entry point also stops lock contention without changing the current generation when its host is shutting down. The server publishes the HTTP client, model client, endpoint, bearer, generation, and validated process identity together as one immutable snapshot, so long-lived consumers never observe mixed replacement state. Explicitly configured LAN gateways have no local process identity and are never supervised or stopped by the desktop shell.

## UI development

The chat UI is TypeScript under `ui/src/`, bundled by esbuild. Building the crate requires Node.js 22: run `npm ci` in `ui/` once per checkout. Every `cargo build` runs the UI build through the crate's `build.rs` (via the shared `build-ui` helper), writing the bundle to `$OUT_DIR/ui-dist/` - never into the repository. Debug builds read the bundle from disk on every request; release builds minify and embed it into the binary. `ui/node_modules/` and `ui/dist/` are gitignored.

The workflow: edit the TypeScript, then `cargo build` (or `cargo run -p workshop-server`). The build script re-bundles whenever `ui/src/` or the static UI files change - a build-script-only rerun, no Rust recompile - and debug builds read the bundle from disk on every request. `npm run build` and `npm run watch` in `ui/` still write `ui/dist/` in place, which nothing serves: that tree exists for the jsdom tests, which import the built bundle.

`npm run typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit`; esbuild strips types without checking them, so the typecheck is advisory. `npm test` runs `node --test`, which discovers every test under `ui/test/` plus any colocated `src/**/*.test.mjs` files; the suite includes a jsdom smoke test that imports the built `dist/app.js` and asserts the workbench mounts (run `npm run build` first).

The chat surface is the agent-session panel (`ui/src/ui/agent-session-view.ts`), rendered from the durable event stream over `GET /agents/ws`. Its input carries the push-to-talk mic (`ui/src/ui/stt.ts`): `SpeechCaptureService` produces little-endian mono PCM16 at 24 kHz, `RealtimeTranscriptionService` speaks the transcription subset through the same-origin `/v1/realtime` relay, and the view replaces one reversible editor range with live hypothesis snapshots until completion. One recording remains one item and take for arbitrary duration while Gateway final throughput keeps pace with capture. If Gateway's 30-second retained PCM ownership is exhausted, the decoded `too_much_unfinalized_audio` event stops capture and commits the still-valid input without clearing accepted visible text; other server errors retain rollback behavior. The mic is gated by the pending input wait, and connection or capture failures are local recoverable status messages. The Workshop never reads speech payloads or owns model lifecycle; the gateway key stays in the server process. `ui/style.css` carries the workshop shell (tree, panels, dictation UI, status bar) and overrides.

The status bar at the bottom of the window renders the observer's `{"type":"status",...}` frames (`ui/src/ui/status-bar.ts`): the label as the bar text, the description as the tooltip, error frames in a distinct color. Debug-severity frames are internal instrumentation and never touch the text. The right slot holds a `<progress>` bar while a frame carries progress, and an activity LED otherwise: a small circle that pulses green on gateway traffic and amber on dictation activity (green wins when both coincide), lit for one pulse window per frame and faded by a CSS transition. The bar's colors, glow radii, and pulse window are CSS custom properties (`--led-green`, `--led-amber`, `--led-off`, `--led-glow-radius`, `--led-pulse-ms`, `--progress-fill`, `--progress-glow`, ...) at the top of `ui/style.css`.

## Skinning

The whole UI skins from the `:root` block at the top of `ui/style.css` - every color, spacing step, radius, font, scrollbar metric, and the status bar's LED and progress effect is a CSS custom property there.

Two ways to reskin:

1. **Edit the block.** Change values in the `:root` block of `ui/style.css` and rebuild (`cargo build`; debug builds serve the bundle from disk). This is the path for changes you keep.
2. **Override from an additional stylesheet.** Add a `<link>` after `/style.css` in `ui/index.html` and redeclare any variable on `:root`. Later declarations win the cascade.

## Run event log

`WorkshopObserver` is the crate's append-only run event log. The `Observer` content hooks append runtime events (the write side), the `EventLog` trait serves indexed reads (the read side), and `subscribe()` broadcasts every appended entry live. Given a persist path it appends each event as one JSONL line behind a versioned header line; `load_from` replays such a file - refusing headers and lines it does not speak - and continues appending to it. A committed fixture in the crate's integration tests pins the version-1 file format against schema drift.

## Agent input waits

`WaitRegistry` holds an agent session's unresolved user-input waits behind single-use cryptographic tokens, retained across socket loss and resent on reconnect. `SessionInputBroker` is the session's input broker behind the script-side `user_input()` - never advertised to a model - which registers a wait, pushes the durable `input_required` frame itself, and suspends until `deliver_input_response` fires `on_user_input` byte-exact and completes the wait. A drop guard turns every dying wait into a durable `input_cancelled` frame, so a cancelled turn never leaks a wait or leaves a stale prompt.

## Agent sessions

`AgentSessions` (reached through `AppState::agents`) is the registry behind `GET /agents/ws`: it discovers `.md` agent prompts from `agents.path` and always offers the embedded built-in `chat` agent, a Markdown prompt running on the unified `promptforge_api` runtime (a directory `chat.md` shadows it). Every agent launches as a `promptforge_api::run` prompt execution. Every session carries the Workshop's input broker behind `user_input`, a persisting `WorkshopObserver` event log at `state_dir/sessions/<session-id>.jsonl`, a model catalog built from the retained gateway catalog, and a `ui()` snapshot serving the selected model and the first granted workspace root. Sessions survive socket disconnect: sockets attach and detach, a reconnect replays the persisted log (every durable frame carries its log index) and re-announces unresolved waits. Live deltas ride a dedicated ephemeral channel, each stamped with the reply id of the durable event that will supersede it. Turn-cancel fires the session's retained cancel handle and relaunches the program over the retained event log - a stop reason, never an error - while `AgentSessions::close` ends a session for good.
