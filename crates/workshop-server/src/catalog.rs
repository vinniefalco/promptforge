//! The chat-capable model catalog push channel, rebroadcast to every
//! connected `/ws` session as a `{"type":"models",...}` frame.
//!
//! The heartbeat republishes the catalog when the gateway comes back
//! (unreachable to connected), so a UI that booted while the gateway was
//! down refreshes its model picker without a reload. The channel is a
//! [`RetainedBus`]: publishing never blocks, a publish with no sessions
//! is a no-op, and a lagging session skips ahead - every push is a
//! complete snapshot, so an overwritten one loses nothing. The bus also
//! retains the newest push, so a session that connects later sends the
//! current catalog immediately - the delivery contract's
//! resend-on-reconnect for ephemeral frames.
