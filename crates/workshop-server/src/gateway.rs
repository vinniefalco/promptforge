//! HTTP client for the PromptForge gateway's OpenAI-compatible API.
//!
//! [`GatewayClient`] wraps `reqwest` with bearer authentication and returns
//! responses as raw bytes so the workshop routes can relay them to the
//! caller byte-for-byte. A non-success status from the gateway is *not* an
//! error here: it is part of the relayed response. Streaming responses
//! (profile switches, cache downloads) are decoded from SSE into a
//! [`SsePayloadStream`] of `data:` payloads.
