//! The gateway heartbeat: a background task polling the gateway's
//! `GET /health` endpoint and publishing reachability to the rest of the
//! server.
//!
//! One task is spawned with the server ([`spawn`]): while the gateway
//! answers, it probes through [`GatewayClient::health`] on the fixed
//! [`HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`] and publishes the outcome to the shared
//! [`GatewayHealth`] flag the gateway-dependent routes read; while the
//! gateway is unreachable, the next probe instead waits out a delay
//! drawn from the shared [`ReconnectBackoff`] - jittered, escalating,
//! and reset only by useful work elsewhere (a delivered token or a
//! successful completion), never by a probe that merely connects, so a
//! gateway that flaps without delivering keeps escalating. When the
//! backoff's total-delay budget exhausts, the loop reports the give-up
//! on the status bus and stops probing for the life of the process.
//! The observer hears about transitions only - the first probe reports
//! the initial state ("Connected to gateway" or "Gateway unreachable"),
//! and after that a status update fires when the answer changes, so a
//! steady state never spams the status bar. Every transition also feeds
//! the Model menu's reachability (so `chat_ready` flips with the
//! gateway), and a transition to reachable (boot's first probe included)
//! refreshes the gateway's profile state and model catalog into their
//! buses. If simultaneous startup leaves either source empty, later healthy
//! ticks retry each source independently until the profile and a selectable
//! model are both ready, then restore the selection exactly once.
//!
//! The task stops through its [`Heartbeat`] handle: the signal wins the
//! loop's selects, so shutdown never waits out a tick or an in-flight
//! probe. The server runs the shutdown inside its graceful-shutdown future.
