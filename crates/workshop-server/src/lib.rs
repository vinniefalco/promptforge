//! PromptForge Workshop HTTP server.
//!
//! Holds the `workshop.toml` configuration, the PromptForge gateway client,
//! and the axum router so `src/main.rs` stays a thin shell. Start at
//! [`Config::load`] for configuration, [`WorkshopObserver`] for the run
//! event log, [`WaitRegistry`] and [`UserInputTool`] for agent input
//! waits, [`AgentSessions`] for the agent-session registry behind
//! `/agents/ws`, and [`router`] for the HTTP API; [`spawn`] runs the whole
//! server in-process on its own thread for embedding binaries.
//!
//! The crate is the composition root of the workshop server
//! decomposition: the feature subsystems (`workshop-sessions`,
//! `workshop-workspace`), the domain services (`workshop-gateway`,
//! `workshop-status`, `workshop-menu`), and the vocabulary crates
//! (`workshop-protocol`, `workshop-registry`, `workshop-support`) are
//! assembled in `app.rs`, where every subsystem self-registers its
//! routes, state handles, and push channels into the registry.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! - Tier: shell; may depend on: the vocabulary crates
//!   (`workshop-protocol`, `workshop-registry`, `workshop-support`),
//!   the service crates (`workshop-gateway`, `workshop-menu`,
//!   `workshop-status`), and the feature crates (`workshop-sessions`,
//!   `workshop-workspace`). Read `AGENTS.md` before adding an import.
//! - Every file in this crate stays under 500 lines; split first, then
//!   edit.
