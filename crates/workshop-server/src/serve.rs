//! In-process serving: the workshop server on a dedicated thread.

//! [`spawn`] builds the shared state, binds the listener, and serves on its
//! own thread with its own tokio runtime, so an embedding binary (the
//! desktop shell, or the server binary itself) keeps its main thread. The
//! call blocks until the listener is bound - that bind is the readiness
//! signal - and the returned [`ServerHandle`] carries the base URL and a
//! graceful-shutdown switch. The stop side is bounded: a watchdog gives
//! in-flight connections a grace window to drain and then tears the runtime
//! down anyway, and a stopped barrier reports [`Termination`] back through
//! [`ServerHandle::shutdown`], so a held socket can never park the host.
