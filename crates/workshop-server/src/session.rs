//! The `/ws` WebSocket endpoint: one persistent socket carrying the
//! workshop's downstream JSON - unsolicited status updates from the
//! observer, model catalog pushes, and workbench snapshots - plus the
//! inbound Model-menu events.
//!
//! A client upgrades `GET /ws` once. The socket carries the Model-menu
//! events inbound. `{"type":"select_model","model":"..."}` selects the
//! chat model: the menu validates the id against the retained catalog and
//! publishes the fresh workbench snapshot, handled inline because a map
//! lookup and a broadcast send cost microseconds; an unknown model is
//! refused with an `error` frame. `{"type":"switch_profile","name":"..."}`
//! starts a gateway profile switch: `begin_switch` publishes the pending
//! snapshot (`switching` set, `chat_ready` false) before the frame
//! handler returns, and the switch itself runs on its own task - it
//! consumes the gateway's stage stream into determinate status-bar
//! progress, refetches the profile state and model catalog, and settles
//! the menu. A second switch while one runs is refused with an `error`
//! frame. Both events echo an `id` on their refusals when the frame
//! carried one. A frame that is not a well-formed menu event is answered
//! with an `error` frame and the session continues. Chat itself lives on
//! the `/agents/ws` socket ([`crate::session_agents`]); this endpoint
//! carries no chat frames.
//!
//! One task owns the socket: a single `select!` loop reads inbound frames
//! and writes every outbound frame itself - no outbox channel, no writer
//! task. Status updates from [`crate::status`], catalog pushes from
//! [`crate::catalog`], and workbench snapshots from [`crate::menu`] flow
//! as they publish. On connect the session first sends the retained
//! status, catalog, and workbench snapshots, honoring the delivery
//! contract's resend promise (see `workshop-protocol`) - the UI boots
//! from this socket alone, with zero HTTP state fetches; after that the
//! buses forward as they publish, and a session too slow to drain them
//! skips ahead to the newest snapshot rather than slowing the producers.
//!
//! The status channel is reached through the subsystem registry
//! ([`AppState::registry`]), not named directly: the status bus is the
//! proof-of-concept self-registrant, and an unregistered slot degrades
//! the session to no status frames rather than failing it.
