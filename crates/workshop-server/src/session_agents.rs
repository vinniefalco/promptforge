//! Agent sessions: discovery of `.lua` agent programs, the
//! [`AgentSessions`] registry, and each session's run lifecycle.
//!
//! A session owns one running agent: its persisting event log
//! ([`crate::observer::WorkshopObserver`], JSONL under
//! `state_dir/sessions/<session-id>.jsonl`), its
//! [`crate::input::WaitRegistry`] and `user_input` tool, its dedicated
//! delta broadcast (deltas never enter the event log), and the retained
//! [`CancelHandle`] behind turn-cancel. The supervisor task relaunches
//! `run_agent` over the retained event log after a turn-cancel -
//! cancellation is a stop reason, never an error - and ends the session
//! when the program returns or fails.
//!
//! **Registry carve-out.** Sessions survive socket disconnect and sockets
//! attach and detach ([`socket`]), so this module keeps the session
//! registry the crate's socket rule otherwise forbids. The rule governed
//! per-request relay work, where every held resource belonged to one
//! socket; an agent session is longer-lived than any socket on purpose,
//! and the registry is the one place that owns it.
//!
//! Reply ids coalesce deltas: every live delta is stamped with the id of
//! the durable event that will supersede it. The id is the count of
//! settled model rounds - [`SessionObserver`] advances it as the reply or
//! tool-call event lands, before the program resumes, and the socket
//! derives the same count from the event sequence itself, so both sides
//! agree without sharing more than the log.
