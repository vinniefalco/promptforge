//! The observer: a broadcast bus carrying status bar updates from every
//! subsystem to every connected `/ws` session.
//!
//! Anything with user-visible latency - startup phases, gateway round
//! trips, dictation and transcription, model downloads - reports what
//! it is doing as a [`StatusBarUpdate`]. The bus is a [`RetainedBus`]:
//! updates fan out to all current subscribers, a send with no
//! subscribers is a no-op, and a subscriber that falls more than
//! [`STATUS_CHANNEL_CAPACITY`] updates behind is told it lagged and resumes
//! at the oldest retained update. Sending never blocks, so instrumenting a
//! hot path cannot stall the subsystem it observes.
//!
//! On the wire each update rides the workshop socket as an unsolicited
//! `{"type":"status",...}` frame (see [`StatusBarUpdate::frame`]). The
//! bus also retains the newest update, so a session that connects later
//! sends the current status immediately - the delivery contract's
//! resend-on-reconnect for ephemeral frames.
