// The service registry: one module-level collection mapping service
// tokens to lazy factories, the SPA-side mirror of the server's
// workshop-registry proxy slots. Subsystems self-register at module scope
// or from the composition root; consumers resolve with getService and
// never name each other's modules. Instantiation is lazy - the factory
// runs on the first get, and the instance is cached for the page
// lifetime, which is what lets session state (zone placement, the tree's
// expansion) survive the panels that own it closing and reopening.
//
// Generic and DOM-free: nothing here may import from the app layers.
