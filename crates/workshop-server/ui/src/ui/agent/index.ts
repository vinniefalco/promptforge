/**
 * The agent directory's activation: installs the agent-session panel
 * factory, resolving the composition root's services through the service
 * registry (absent in standalone panel tests, where the panel stays
 * silent). Called once by the panel registry when the directory's chunk
 * first loads; the returned disposable is held for the page lifetime.
 *
 * Code blocks in the agent feed highlight through Shiki, whose init is
 * async and started at module scope; register() awaits readiness (with
 * failures logged, not thrown) before answering so the panel registry
 * mounts the panel only after highlighting is settled - the first
 * painted message is never the degraded unhighlighted render. A failed
 * init must not break the panel - the renderer degrades to plain
 * <pre><code> blocks instead.
