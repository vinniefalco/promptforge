//! The `/agents/ws` WebSocket endpoint: one socket serving one agent
//! session at a time.
//!
//! On connect the server pushes the discovered agent list. The client
//! then sends `{"type":"launch","agent":"..."}` to start a session or
//! `{"type":"attach","session":"..."}` to reattach to a running one -
//! sessions outlive sockets, so a reconnect replays the persisted event
//! log from index zero and re-announces every unresolved input wait.
//! While attached, the loop streams four families: durable
//! `agent_event` frames drained from the session's event log by a
//! per-client cursor (the log's broadcast is only the wakeup, so a
//! lagged receiver loses nothing), ephemeral `agent_delta` frames from
//! the session's delta channel (drops repair via the superseding event),
//! the durable `input_required` / `input_cancelled` wait frames, and
//! ephemeral `error` frames reporting a failed model round the program
//! survived or a run that ended in error.
//! `{"type":"input_response",...}` answers a wait and dispatches the
//! turn (the Thinking status push); `{"type":"cancel"}` fires the
//! session's turn-cancel - a stop reason, never an error, so nothing is
//! answered and the frames that follow are the relaunch's own.
//!
//! One task owns the socket: a single `select!` loop reads and writes
//! the same handle, per the crate's socket rule; the session registry
//! behind it is [`super`]'s documented carve-out.
