//! The user-input wait: the [`WaitRegistry`] of single-use wait tokens,
//! the Workshop's `user_input` tool, and the `input_response` producer
//! that completes a wait.
//!
//! An agent program asks its operator for input by calling the
//! `user_input` tool - session-supplied code, never advertised to a
//! model. Its `call()` registers a wait, announces it with a durable
//! `input_required` frame, and suspends on the wait's receiver until the
//! session delivers the operator's answer ([`deliver_input_response`]) or
//! the wait dies. A dying wait is an outcome, never silence: every path
//! out of an unresolved wait - the future dropped by a turn-cancel, the
//! wait cancelled out of the registry - removes the entry and pushes a
//! durable `input_cancelled` frame, so the SPA never pins its input box
//! to a dead token. Unresolved waits are retained across socket loss and
//! re-announced on reconnect: sessions outlive sockets.
