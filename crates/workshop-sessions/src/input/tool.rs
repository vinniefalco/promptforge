/// The Workshop's `user_input` tool: suspends an agent program until its
/// operator types into the session's input box.
///
/// A host-primitive [`Tool`] the session constructs per agent session -
/// it is never advertised to a model (the agent driver advertises only
/// the aliases a `models.chat` call names, and host primitives are
/// excluded from that set), and only the agent program itself calls it.
/// `call()` opens a wait in the session's [`WaitRegistry`], pushes the
/// `input_required` frame itself, and suspends until the wait resolves;
/// `run_agent` has no user-input awareness because this tool is the
/// caller's own code.
///
/// The output is **trusted and structured**: a JSON object with `text`
/// (the operator's input, byte-exact - the operator is not an attacker of
/// their own session, so no nonce envelope ever wraps it) and `images`
/// (present and always empty until SPA attachments land). The session
/// binds this tool with the structured output kind, so the object resumes
/// into Lua as a table - `result.text`, `result.images` - through the
/// serde boundary; structured output stays restricted to trusted tools.
