//! The hub-to-status-bar renderer: a task that samples the process
//! [`ProgressHub`] and drives the status bar's progress indicator through
//! [`Push`], so the anti-flicker policy lives here and the UI stays dumb.
//!
//! The indicator appears only once an operation has been live for
//! `SHOW_DELAY`, stays up at least `MIN_VISIBLE` once shown, and
//! displays the monotonic aggregate from [`ProgressMeter`]: the bar never
//! flashes for sub-second work, never resets mid-operation, and never
//! steps backward. Status texts ("Listening...", failures) stay explicit
//! push calls in the subsystems that own them; the trees own only
//! fractional progress. When the hub's last tree detaches, the renderer
//! returns the bar to rest with [`Push::push_idle`].
