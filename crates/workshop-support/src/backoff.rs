//! Gateway reconnect backoff: jittered exponential probe delays that
//! reset only on useful work, never on mere connect.
//!
//! One [`ReconnectBackoff`] is shared between the heartbeat (which draws
//! a delay before each probe while the gateway is unreachable) and the
//! agent sessions (which record useful work - a completed model reply).
//! A gateway that connects but never delivers keeps escalating:
//! answering the health probe is not useful work, so a flapping
//! upstream cannot ride the connect/disconnect cycle back to the fast
//! schedule (rqbit's anti-flap discipline). The delays are jittered so
//! workshops restarted together do not probe in phase, and a
//! total-delay budget bounds the retry campaign as a whole: once the
//! cumulative delay handed out since the last useful work crosses it,
//! [`ReconnectBackoff::next_delay`] answers `None` and the caller
//! stops reconnecting.
