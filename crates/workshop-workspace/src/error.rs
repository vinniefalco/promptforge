//! The workspace operation failure type and its wire mapping.

//! status code and one machine-readable envelope code, rendered through
//! `workshop-protocol`'s [`ErrorEnvelope`] at the route boundary.
//! Internal failure detail (the source chain) reaches the response body
//! in debug builds only; production bodies stay at each variant's own
//! message.
